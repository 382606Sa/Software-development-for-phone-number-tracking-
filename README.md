3. Configure logging and error handling

Running the Application
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Activate the virtual environment (if using)
3. Run the application using `python app.py`
4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` (or specified port)

Using the Application
1. Track phone numbers by entering them in the specified field
2. View logs and tracking history
3. Configure settings and preferences (if applicable)

Troubleshooting
1. Check logs for errors and exceptions
